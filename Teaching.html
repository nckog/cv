<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>I have had several years of experience teaching privately and in various institutions, to all abilities and age groups</p>
Teaching, for me, is a very rewarding process. As I have got older, so I increasingly understand the importance and value of passing on information and learning, to help others.<br>
I truly enjoy the tecahing/learning process. I don't see it as a one way path, as in, I'm the teacher and I instruct the pupil.<br>
Rather, I see it as a two way process. It is about me nurturing the student to become the musician that only they can be.<br>
And if I am doing a good job, I will learn about the student, I will learn a different perspective on music and also I will learn about myself - so there is a huge benefit for student <em>and</em> teacher.
